# Lab 1: Deploy Azure Database for PostgreSQL

 Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a fully managed database service provided by Microsoft Azure, offering PostgreSQL as the underlying database engine. It allows users to deploy, manage, and scale PostgreSQL databases in 
 the cloud with ease. With features such as automated backups, high availability, and security built-in, Azure Database for PostgreSQL enables reliable and secure operations for applications requiring PostgreSQL 
 databases. Additionally, it provides compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools and extensions, ensuring a seamless transition for developers and administrators.
